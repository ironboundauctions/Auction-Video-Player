# 🚀 Auto-Updater Setup Guide

Your auction video player now has a professional auto-updater! Here's how to set it up:

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Auto-updater code is implemented
- ✅ Update notification UI is ready
- ✅ Version history and rollback system
- ✅ Secure update verification

## 📋 Setup Steps

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub.com** and create a new repository called `auction-video-player`
2. **Make it public** (required for free GitHub releases)
3. **Copy your repository URL**

### Step 2: Update package.json

Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` in package.json with your actual GitHub username:

```json
"publish": {
  "provider": "github",
  "owner": "your-actual-username",
  "repo": "auction-video-player"
}
```

### Step 3: Get GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to GitHub** → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. **Generate new token** with these permissions:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `write:packages` (Upload packages to GitHub Package Registry)
3. **Copy the token** (you'll need it for publishing)

### Step 4: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# In your project folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with auto-updater"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auction-video-player.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 5: Build and Publish First Release

```bash
# Set your GitHub token (Windows)
set GH_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Build and publish to GitHub releases
npm run dist -- --publish=always
```

## 🎯 How Updates Work

### For Users:
1. **Install once** - Users download and install the `.exe` file
2. **Automatic checks** - App checks for updates on startup
3. **Background downloads** - Updates download while using the app
4. **One-click install** - "Restart & Install" button applies updates
5. **No reinstalling** - Updates apply seamlessly

### For You (Publishing Updates):
1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Update version**: `npm version patch` (or minor/major)
3. **Publish update**: `npm run dist -- --publish=always`
4. **Users get notified** automatically!

## 🔄 Version Types

```bash
# Bug fixes (1.0.1 → 1.0.2)
npm version patch

# New features (1.0.1 → 1.1.0)
npm version minor

# Major changes (1.0.1 → 2.0.0)
npm version major
```

## 🛠️ Testing Updates

1. **Install version 1.0.1** on a test machine
2. **Make a small change** (like updating a text label)
3. **Increment version**: `npm version patch`
4. **Publish**: `npm run dist -- --publish=always`
5. **Open the installed app** - it should detect and download the update!
