# 🚀 Auto-Updater Implementation Guide

## ✅ What Was Added

Your auction video player now has a professional auto-updater system! Here's what's new:

### 🔧 New Files:
- `electron/updater.js` - Auto-updater logic
- `src/components/UpdateNotification.tsx` - Update UI component
- `AUTO-UPDATER-SETUP.md` - This guide

### 📝 Modified Files:
- `electron/main.js` - Added updater initialization
- `electron/preload.js` - Added update IPC methods
- `src/App.tsx` - Added update notification component
- `src/types/electron.d.ts` - Added update type definitions
- `package.json` - Added electron-updater dependency

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **App starts** → Automatically checks for updates after 30 seconds
2. **Update found** → Downloads in background, shows notification
3. **Download complete** → Shows "Restart & Install" button
4. **User clicks** → App restarts with new version installed

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Update package.json
Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username:
```json
"publish": {
  "provider": "github",
  "owner": "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME",
  "repo": "auction-video-player"
}
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add auto-updater system"

# Create repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/auction-video-player.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Get GitHub Token
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` permissions
3. Copy the token

### Step 4: Build and Publish First Release
```bash
# Set your GitHub token (Windows)
set GH_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Set your GitHub token (Mac/Linux)
export GH_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Build and publish
npm run dist -- --publish=always
```

## 🎉 User Experience

### First Install:
- User downloads and runs the `.exe` installer (one time)
- App installs normally with desktop shortcut

### Updates:
- App checks for updates automatically
- Downloads happen in background during auctions
- User sees notification: "Update available - downloading..."
- When ready: "Update ready - restart to apply"
- Quick restart applies update - no reinstalling!
